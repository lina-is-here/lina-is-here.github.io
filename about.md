Hi! I'm Lina â€” short from Angelina. Currently, I'm a software engineer at Red Hat in the Czech Republic. 
IT and programming were my hobby for a long time before it turned into a full-time job in 2017.

Since I started, I keep my notes in `~/Notes` that became the source and inspiration for this blog.

If you find it useful, I will be happy to hear from you!
